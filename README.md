# Eye_Diseases_prediction
The project centers on the prediction of eye diseases with the aid of sophisticated deep
learning models, specifically VGG16 and ResNet50. The system receives input images of
eyes and reliably identifies various diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy, myopia, hypertension, and normal eyes. Of the two models, VGG16 works
better, with enhanced accuracy in identifying the mentioned ailments. The predictions are
made based on the ODIR (Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition) database, a reliable
dataset with a range of labeled eye images.
To ensure that the predictions are understandable and not cryptic, the project utilizes
Explainable Al (LIME). LIME points out which particular regions of the eye image
affected the decision of the model. This helps doctors, patients, and other users
understand how the prediction was arrived at, and trust in the system as well as the output.
This project provides the precise, reliable, simple-to-use device for early diagnosis of eye
illnesses. Rapidly and simply gained results will cause doctors to make improved
diagnoses and allow patients to be treated when necessary, thus rendering eye treatment
more effective and accessible to all.
